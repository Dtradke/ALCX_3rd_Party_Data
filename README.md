This repository works towards the free square bounty question on the webpage https://www.notion.so/Analytics-Bounties-for-Alchemix-ffd6c25bdef3486c9b8dfa9476ac6a39. With this question, we are interested in understanding how the Alchemix (ALCX) Cryptocurrency price fluctuates with the top currencies in the market using data from Flipside Crypto and the CCI30 dataset.

Our solution is located in a jupyter notebook. 

We have included multiple ways to view the report:

ALCX_3rd_Party_Data.ipynb --> This is a jupyter notebook. The code can be actually run in here by execting "jupyter notebook COMP_3rd_Party.ipynb" in terminal from this directory.LCX

ALCX_3rd_Party_Data.pdf --> This is an exported PDF document of the write-up and code included in the jupyter notebook. This also includes the graphs that the code generates.
